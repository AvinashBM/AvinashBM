Three resources CPU, memory, and IO are bundled into units of compute scale called Data Warehouse Units (DWUs). A DWU represents an abstract, normalized measure of compute resources and performance.
Dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) is a scale-out system that can provision vast amounts of compute and query sizeable quantities of data.
DW Capacity limits
1.	Max DWU for a single dedicated SQL pool - Gen1: DW6000, Gen2: DW30000c
2.	Maximum Concurrent open sessions – 1024 (DWU1000c) and 512 (DWU500c)
3.	Maximum memory for prepared statements – 20MB
4.	Maximum concurrent queries – 128
5.	Maximum GB for tempdb – 399GB to 3.99TB
6.	Database Max size – 240TB, on Clustered columnstore compression is estimated at 5X can store 1PB
7.	Table Max size – 60TB
8.	Tables per DB – 100000
9.	Column per table – 1024
10.	Bytes per column - Limit is 8000 for char data types, 4000 for nvarchar, or 2 GB for MAX data types.
11.	Bytes per row, defined size - 8060 bytes
12.	Partitions per table - 15,000
13.	Characters per partition boundary value – 4000
